# Implementation of HashMap and Binary Search Tree in PHP. 

**HashMap** is a data structure that is able to map certain keys to certain values. It uses a function on the key to determine where to place the key's value in the array. 

**Binary Search** Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key and right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
